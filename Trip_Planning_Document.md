### Additional Options (Beyond Core Itinerary)

**Granada & Alhambra** - **REMOVED FROM ITINERARY (to save travel time)**
- **Why:** The Alhambra is one of the world's most stunning architectural sites - a palace and fortress complex that represents the peak of Moorish architecture in Spain. Granada itself is a beautiful, authentic Andalusian city with a unique atmosphere, excellent food, and stunning views of the Sierra Nevada mountains.
- **Highlights:**
  - **Alhambra Palace:** Massive complex including the Nasrid Palaces (incredible Islamic architecture with intricate details), Generalife Gardens (beautiful water features and gardens), Alcazaba (fortress with city views), and Palace of Charles V. This is a full-day experience that requires advance booking (tickets sell out months in advance).
  - **Albaicín Neighborhood:** Historic Moorish quarter with narrow, winding streets, white-washed houses, and stunning views of the Alhambra. Very walkable and authentic.
  - **Sacromonte:** Traditional gypsy quarter with cave houses, flamenco shows, and great views.

  - **Food Scene:** Excellent tapas culture (many places give free tapas with drinks), authentic Andalusian cuisine.
- **Hiking & Nature:** The Alhambra has extensive gardens to explore; the Albaicín offers great walking with views; nearby Sierra Nevada mountains offer hiking opportunities (though may be too strenuous for some).

2. **Costa Brava (Cadaqués or Tossa de Mar)** - **Authentic Coastal Villages with Hiking**

Toledo offers incredible history and culture (Christian, Muslim, Jewish all coexisted here), stunning architecture, and is very walkable (hilly in parts = good exercise!). You can walk the old town extensively, climb to viewpoints, explore the castle, walk along the river. Segovia has that amazing Roman aqueduct (you can walk along it!), fairy-tale castle (walking through the castle grounds), plus it's mostly flat and very walkable.

This could be a nice day trip from Barcelona or a stop on the way to/from Costa Brava.

- **Ronda** - Dramatic and authentic, less touristy, stunning natural setting, great for walking the old town and bridge areas
- **Peñíscola** - Castle walking, coastal town, less touristy, authentic Spanish coastal experience
- **Smaller Andalusian white villages (pueblos blancos)** - If you rent a car, these offer the most authentic Spanish village experience, but require a car to access

- **Barcelona + Montserrat:** City food scene + Mountain hiking = food and serious exercise (day trip option)
- **Barcelona + Girona:** City food scene + medieval town walking = food and exploration (day trip option)

## Accommodation Websites & Platform Recommendations

### Quick Answer: Is VRBO the Best?

**Short Answer:** VRBO is good but not necessarily the best. Use multiple platforms and compare.

**Best Strategy:**
1. **Start with HomeToGo** - compares all platforms (AirBNB, VRBO, Booking.com, etc.) in one search
2. **Use AirBNB** for apartment rentals (best selection, good for large groups)
3. **Use Booking.com** for hotels or if you want more reliability
4. **Check VRBO** but read reviews carefully (some users report issues)
5. **Always verify** property has license number (Spain requirement)

**VRBO Pros & Cons:**
- ✅ Good for entire homes
- ✅ Good for large groups
- ❌ Some users report customer service issues
- ❌ Some properties have condition problems
- ❌ Smaller selection than AirBNB

**Recommendation:** Don't rely solely on VRBO. Use HomeToGo to compare, then book on the platform with the best option for your needs.
